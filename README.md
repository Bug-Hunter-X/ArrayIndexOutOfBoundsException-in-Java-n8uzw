# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` shows the corrected version.

The error occurs because the loop iterates one time too many, trying to access an index that doesn't exist in the array. This is a frequent mistake when working with arrays, particularly for novice programmers.

The solution involves carefully reviewing array bounds and ensuring the loop condition accurately reflects the valid index range.
